                <h3>RISK DISCLOSURE</h3>
                <p>Trading and investing in securities, particularly leveraged ETFs, options-based ETFs, and high-yield investment products like YieldMax ETFs, involves substantial risk of loss. These investments are speculative and carry significant risks including:</p>
                
                <ul class="risk-list">
                    <li><strong>Principal Loss Risk:</strong> You may lose some or all of your investment</li>
                    <li><strong>Volatility Risk:</strong> Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods</li>
                    <li><strong>NAV Decay Risk:</strong> Covered call strategies typically experience declining net asset values over time</li>
                    <li><strong>Distribution Risk:</strong> High yields are not guaranteed and can be reduced or eliminated</li>
                    <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> You may not be able to sell your investments when desired</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> Overall market conditions can negatively impact all investments</li>
                    <li><strong>Concentration Risk:</strong> Sector-specific ETFs carry additional risks related to their underlying holdings</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your investments.</p>
