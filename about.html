            <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
            <p>The 90.27% yield from MSTY isn't a typo—it's a financial anomaly that's rewriting the rules of income investing. While traditional dividend aristocrats struggle to deliver 3% yields, YieldMax ETFs are engineering monthly payouts that would make a hedge fund manager blush.</p>
            
            <p>MSTY Millionaire exists to demystify this complex world of covered call ETFs and provide retail investors with institutional-grade intelligence. We believe that sophisticated income generation strategies shouldn't be reserved for Wall Street elites.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">The YieldMax Revolution</h2>
            <p>YieldMax ETFs represent the democratization of sophisticated options strategies. These funds use covered call writing to generate income from high-volatility stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTY), Tesla (TSLY), and NVIDIA (NVDY).</p>
            
            <p>The mathematics are compelling: while the S&P 500 yields 1.5%, these ETFs are delivering yields that can exceed 100% annually. But with great yield comes great responsibility—understanding the mechanics, risks, and optimal timing is crucial for success.</p>
